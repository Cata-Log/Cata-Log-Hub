# Broken Provider Report

<!--
Thank you for your effort to report a broken provider implementation in Cata-Log!

Before you submit this report, please make sure that

- the provider is flagged as broken and may not just be misconfigured

- the provider is still flagged as broken after you force-update it (POST to /api/v1/providers/{provider_id}/job/run).

If these criteria are met, please go ahead and fill out the report.
The more information you provide the more material we can work with
in order to reach a quick and complete fix.
-->

- [] I have checked that there is no existing issue dealing with this problem.


## Provider name

<!--
The name of the broken provider. (e.g. aldi-sued-deutschland).
-->


## Cata-Log version

<!--
The version of the application you used to discover that the provider is broken.
Ideally a docker image tag (not 'latest').
-->


## Logs *

<!--
Please put the parts of the logfile(s),
which show the provider being insuccessfully updated, or attach them.
You can find the logfiles in the */var/log/cata-log-hub/* docker volume.

## Possible diagnosis

<!--
If you have an idea what may be the reason for the broken provider please tell us.
